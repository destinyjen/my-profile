            <h2>Destiny Jenkins</h2>
            <p>My name is Destiny. I am an Executive Assistant pursuing a Software Engineering career in the Technology field. I’ve spent a few years working at a corporate company supporting the Technology Division as an EA. After a year of supporting the Division, I find myself even more infatuated, eager to learn, passionate, and motivated to be IN the department solving problems and not just supporting them. I’ve attended countless meetings in the field, not because I have to but because I want to. My interest in the field led me to take a Web Development Bootcamp.</p>
